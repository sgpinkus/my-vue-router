# MY-VUE-ROUTER
Simple alternative to vue-router, with %12 of the code and %7 of the features!

  - Simple flat routing table - no nested.
  - Using path-to-regexp for param parsing.
  - No entry guards, no async, no global $route and $router, no named views, no other stuff.
  - Works transparently with #fragments.
